Start with the official React documentation for core concepts, then build momentum through hands-on tutorials and a simple project like a to-do list. As a 10-year React expert, I'd prioritize practical learning over theory to get you building fast for your project.

Prerequisites
Know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including ES6 features like arrow functions and destructuring). If needed, brush up via freeCodeCamp's JavaScript section first.
​

Core Concepts
Master these fundamentals in order: components and JSX, props, state with useState, event handling, conditional rendering, lists with .map() and keys, and basic styling via className. The official React "Quick Start" covers 80% of daily use in interactive examples.
​

Recommended Materials
Official React Docs (react.dev/learn): Free, interactive tutorial on basics—no setup needed initially. Follow the Quick Start, then the full tutorial for a tic-tac-toe app.
​
​

freeCodeCamp React Tutorial (YouTube, 15+ hours): Builds 6 projects like a travel journal and meme generator while teaching hooks progressively. Interactive challenges keep it engaging; code on GitHub.

Scrimba React Course: Free interactive version of the above—edit code in-browser.
​

Learning Path
Days 1-2: Read react.dev/learn Quick Start; create your first app with Vite (npx create-vite@latest).

Days 3-7: Watch freeCodeCamp video sections 1-3; code along for components, props, state, forms.

Days 8+: Tackle sections 4-6 for useEffect, APIs; install React DevTools extension.

Simple Starter Project
Build a to-do list: Add tasks via form (useState for list), mark complete (update state), delete items, persist in localStorage. Uses components, props, state, events—perfect for basics. Source code/examples available online.
​

Setup Tips
Run npx create-react-app my-app or Vite for faster setup. Use VS Code with ES7+ React snippets and React DevTools. Practice daily for 1-2 hours; deploy to Netlify for free.
